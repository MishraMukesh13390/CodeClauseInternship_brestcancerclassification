It accounts for 25% of all cancer cases, and affected over 2.1 Million people in 2015 alone. It starts when cells in the breast begin to grow out of control. These cells usually form tumors that can be seen via X-ray or felt as lumps in the breast area.\n","\n","The key challenges against it’s detection is how to classify tumors into malignant (cancerous) or benign(non cancerous). We ask you to complete the analysis of classifying these tumors using machine learning (with SVMs) and the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset.\n","\n","Acknowledgements:\n","This dataset has been referred from Kaggle.\n","\n","Objective:\n","Understand the Dataset & cleanup (if required).\n","Build classification models to predict whether the cancer type is Malignant or Benign.\n","Also fine-tune the hyperparameters & compare the evaluation metrics of various classification algorithms.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"e6JIh49SBPBl","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1692812206367,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":686,"user":{"displayName":"AMM
